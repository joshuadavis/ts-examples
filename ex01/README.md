This is a hello world static web asset example.

- The source HTML page is `index.html`
- The Typescript sources are in `src/index.ts`
- These are bundled up into the `dist` directory.
- Initialized with "Progressive Web App" (PWA) enabled, so there is a service worker defined.

This project has been created using **webpack-cli**, you can now run:

```
npm run build
```

to bundle your application.
